                                <h3>1. Pizza:</h3>
                                <p>It is not possible to talk about Italian cuisine without mentioning pizza.
                                    Pizza dates back to Naples in the 18th century, and is now one of the most popular
                                    foods in the world.
                                    Traditional pizza is made in a wood-fired oven and features a thin crust and simple
                                    ingredients like fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil.</p>
                                <h3>2. Pasta</h3>
                                <p>Pasta is an essential part of Italian cuisine, and comes in many shapes and sizes.
                                    Popular pasta dishes include spaghetti bolognese (with meat sauce), fettuccine
                                    alfredo (with
                                    cream sauce and cheese), and lasagna (layers of pasta, meat, and cheese). The key to
                                    making delicious pasta is to use fresh ingredients and cook the pasta properly to
                                    achieve
                                    an al dente consistency.</p>
                                <h3>3. Tiramisu</h3>
                                <p>Tiramisu is one of the most famous Italian desserts, and its origin goes back to the
                                    Veneto region. It consists of layers of biscuits dipped in coffee, a mixture of
                                    cream
                                    cheese (mascarpone), and cocoa. This delicious dessert is the perfect choice to end
                                    a
                                    perfectly Italian meal.</p>
                                <h3>4. Risotto</h3>
                                <p>Risotto is a traditional Italian dish made with short-grain rice that is slowly
                                    cooked with broth until creamy.
                                    There are many types of risotto, including saffron risotto, mushroom risotto, and
                                    seafood risotto.
                                    The success of risotto depends on constant stirring and the use of high-quality
