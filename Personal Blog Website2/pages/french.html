                                <h3>History of French cuisine:</h3>
                                <p>French cuisine has deep roots dating back to the Middle Ages, where lavish royal
                                    banquets characterized this era. French cuisine developed greatly during the 17th
                                    and 18th centuries, when the first cookbooks began to appear and French chefs began
                                    laying the foundations of modern cooking. Today, French cuisine is considered a
                                    symbol of elegance and luxury, and varies greatly between the different regions of
                                    France.</p>

                                <h3>1. Croissant:</h3>
                                <p>One cannot talk about French cuisine without mentioning croissants. Made with
                                    delicate, multi-layered butter dough, this hearty breakfast is an icon of French
                                    baking. Serve croissants with coffee or hot chocolate, preferably fresh and crispy
                                    on the outside and soft on the inside.</p>
                                <h3>2. Ratatouille:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Ratatouille is a traditional vegetarian dish from the Provence region, consisting of
                                    grilled vegetables such as eggplant, zucchini, peppers, and onions, seasoned with
                                    aromatic herbs such as thyme and rosemary. This simple and unpretentious dish is an
                                    icon of French home cooking and serves as a model of simple, fresh flavours.</p>
                                <h3>3. Coq au Vin:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Coq au Vin is a traditional dish consisting of chicken slowly cooked in red wine
                                    with vegetables and herbs. Believed to date back to the Middle Ages, this dish is a
                                    wonderful example of classic French cooking that combines rich flavors with precise
                                    techniques.</p>
                                <h3>4. Crème Brûlée:</h3>

                                    This luxurious dessert is one of the most famous French desserts. It consists of
                                    smooth vanilla cream and is covered with a crunchy layer of burnt sugar. When you
                                    break the top layer with a spoon, the soft cream is revealed, making this contrast
                                    in texture one of the secrets to the appeal of this dessert.
